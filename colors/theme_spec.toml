bg                 = "#ffffff" # background color.
fg                 = "#000000" # foreground color.
cursor             = "#bae847" # cursor color - should stand out against both background, foreground, palette, and grayscale colors, yet be a variant of the accent or selection colors.  this color should be lively with a unique personality.
selection          = "#ececa3" # highlight/selection color, should stand out against background, foreground, and grayscale colors, yet be a different complementary color to the palette colors.
palette_accent_1   = "#f2fae9" # palette accent color closest to background.  this color is used as a light background highlight instead of the primary background color.
palette_accent_2   = "#d5f5d5" # palette accent color intermediate to palette_accent_1 and palette_accent_3.  this color is used for background highlights of specific special characters on top of palette_accent_1.
palette_accent_3   = "#4d6b53" # intermediary palette in between palette_accent_1 (closest to background) and palette_accent_5 (closest to foreground).  this should be closer to the foreground color than background color.  it is used for special font foreground.
palette_accent_4   = "#374f2f" # palette accent color intermediate to palette_accent_3 and palette_accent_5.  this should be much closer to the foreground color than palette_accent_3 is.
palette_accent_5   = "#304529" # palette accent color closest to foreground.  this should be nearly the same color as the foreground color.
gray_scale_1       = "#eeeeee" # gray color closest to background.  this should be just barely perceptible next to the background color.
gray_scale_2       = "#b9b9b9" # gray color intermediate to gray_scale_1 and gray_scale_3.  this should be easily perceptible on top of the background color but still much closer to background than foreground color.
gray_scale_3       = "#8e8e8e" # intermediary color between gray_scale_1 (closest to background) and gray_scale_5 (closest to foreground).  This should be closer to the foreground color than the background color.
gray_scale_4       = "#747474" # gray color intermeidate to gray_scale_3 and gray_scale_5.  this should be very close in shade and darkness to gray_scale_5.
gray_scale_5       = "#464646" # gray color closest to foreground.  this should be just barely perceptible next to the background color.
alert              = "#800400" # clearly distinct color that stands out against other background, foreground, cursor, selection, palette_accent, and gray_scale colors.  should be a variant shade of minor_alert color, yet closer to the foreground color than background color.
minor_alert        = "#ffd3d3" # clearly distinct color that stands out against other background, foreground, cursor, selection, palette_accent, and gray_scale colors.  should be a variant shade of alert color, yet closer to the background color than foreground color.
