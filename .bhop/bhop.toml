[editors]
# Use this section to define alternate editors for individual
# file extensions.  Set the extension on the right and the command
# to open the editor for that extension on the right.
#
# If a file is opened without a specified extension, the default
# editor will be used to open it.
#
# For example, use Jupyter Notebooks with IPython files, you can set:
#
#       ipynb="jupyter-notebook"
#
# and anytime bunnyhop is used to open a shortcut to a .ipynb file,
# it will open it in Jupyter.
#
# As another example, if you want to open normal Python files in
# VSCode, you can set:
#
#       py="code"
#
# If you want to open Scala files in Intellij, you can set:
#
#       sc="idea"
#       scala="idea"
#       sbt="idea"
#
# Note that it had to be defined for all of the relevant
# Scala file extensions.
#
# I pretty much just use Neovim (the GOAT) for everything but
# notebooks.  For notebooks I use: `ipynb="euporia-notebook"`
ipynb="code"
