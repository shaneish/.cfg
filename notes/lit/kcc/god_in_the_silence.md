# 1 Kings 19:11-13, God in the Silence in Three Parts, Denna the Liliyyoth, and Kvothe's Rise Behind the Stone Door
so tbh i just started *the wise man's fear* so i may be missing quite a bit, but there are strong textual references to biblical passages and stories that i've yet to see any discussion of (possibly a lot of inspiration from extra biblical/jewish mythology too).  the biggest of these references imho is clearly 1 Kings 19:11-13 -- once you map this onto the text, it opens *a lot* of doors.  once you start peeling back the layers on the premise that "god is in the silence"/"god is the silence", some very big dominos start to fall into place.  i have also only recently begun a journey with biblical inspiration and the textual analysis it entails, so i'm i'm a mere baby on both sides of this coin -- obsessive with both but finished with neither -- so i'm excited to here the perspective of others who have inhabited these spaces longer than i.

if you're going to look it up in the bible, i recommend [the nrsv translation](https://www.bible.com/bible/2016/1KI.19.11-13.NRSV) since i believe it (or very similar one) may have inspired rothfuss.  it is an absolutely *beautiful* passage (one of my favorites) so you can look up the entire thing if you want, but i'd rather share a poem i made from the passage directly which summarizes the passage:
```

```

this is actually a fairly well-known passage (for bible nerds -- the new pope referenced it recently).  looking at it, it's *easy* to see the connection between it and kcc.  God is not in the wind, but the silence that follows.  throughout the first book (which is the only one i've read so far), it really adds a hidden depth to the text with the understanding that *God is the silence* -- the silence that follows the storm.  some interesting places this really shines are:
1) the silence chapters obviously
2) elodin's words to kvothe after he first called the name of the wind

I can leave you to fully explore the implications of "god is in the silence," but i do want to hit on one of the "silence in 3 parts" chapters directly because when you analyze them under this lens the silence takes on almost trinitarian significance -- with kvothe taking on the trinitarian aspect with very deep meaning (including the meaning for the title of the next book, "the stone door").  when an author repeatedly reuses and references the same textual themes/motifs, there's a good chance it has a much deeper meaning within the work itself -- especially when those passages are so beautifully beautiful (cryptic and poetic) and especially especially when those passages form the very start and very end of every single book.  i call them the *silence in three parts* bookends, because that's what they are -- works of art which surround books on both end like a bookend, hugging them gently, squeezing them tightly, holding the entire story together.  a firm foundation keeping the books themselves standing proudly.

i'm convinced kcc is deeply influenced by biblical/extra biblical mythology at a fundamental level and no level is more fundamental than our *silence in three parts.*  before i begin to breakdown those three parts and map them to their biblical themes (and then map them back to kvothe's story -- i call this the "snip snap" journey of abstract analysis after michael scott), you should take this opportunity to ponder the meaning/implications and crack open one of the *silence bookends* yourself.  there's a *very* critical extra-biblical framework -- one which is foundational to the most of christianity's strong felt splinters -- which splits something important into three distinct parts with three distinct realms of influence.  i'm sure the perceptive among you can already see it, but *please* take a look at the *silence bookends* first -- i do not wish to shove a perspective down your throat, i want you to form your own perspective and take this journey with me.

# the wise man's fear - prologue
### a silence in three parts
##### (a god in three parts)

i guess to start this off, i will simply quote *wise man's fear*'s prologue and highlight the "realm" each of silence's three parts inhabit.  we will look at this from the trinitarian view of orthodox christianity (the most common christian interpretation of God).  if you aren't a trinitarian that's fine -- i'm not either, i believe all things (including the body and spirit) emanate from the immanent -- but that is how i read the inspired text of rothfuss, so that is how i will interpret it.

it's important to note that rothfuss seems to make liberal use of (extra) biblical motifs and themes, but not in a way that coheres directly with any one underlying motif or theme.  there is no one-to-one (bijective) map from these books to (extra) biblical stories, rather, the relationship seems to be onto (surjective) -- many motifs and themes from disparate parts of the (extra-)biblical (non)canon are collapsed down on top of the single story we read today.  kvothe assumes attributes and abilities of many different characters, though some of these are more prominent than others.

i will refer to them as "thirds" and start with the first.  in each of the *silence bookends*, the first third neatly inhabits the 2nd paragraph, the second third neatly inhabits the 3rd, and the third third neatly inhabits the rest of the chapter text.

##### the first third:
this first third silence is the silence of *the father*, the aspect which created the universe and touches everything within it.  the father's realm is over the physical/spatial world -- He is vast and expansive, powerfully powerful yet sometimes gentle.

the father is the aspect of God we saw in the reading of 1 Kings 19:11-13 above -- this is the silence after the wind.  again, i encourage you to read elodin's conversation with kvothe after he first calls the name of the wind, it is a very powerful moment and helps 

one of my fav passages about the father is [Psalm 139:7-8](https://www.bible.com/bible/2016/PSA.139.nrsv), which i think also served as a less direct inspiration in these books: "where can i go from Your spirit? or where can i flee from Your presence? if i ascend to heaven, You are there; if i make my bed in Sheol [pre-hell hell], **You are there**."

some quotes from the bookends and how they align with the father:
  * "the most obvious part was a vast, echoing quiet made by things that were lacking."
    + the first third of silence is expansive and deep, it's presence felt strongly by it's absence.  it touches all things, for all things are lacking (in trinitarian christianity, at least, but particularly in protestantism and catholicism).
  * "if there had been a storm, raindrops would have tapped and pattered against the selas vines behind the inn.  thunder would've *muttered* and *rumbled* and *chased* the silence down the road like fallen autumn leaves."
    + the first third is powerful -- it scares thunder and lightning itself -- yet gentle when it moves.  this is a silence beyond the storm, a very neat reference that seems to tie directly back to 1 kings 19:11-13.
  * "if there had been travelers stirring in their rooms they would've stretched and grumbled the silence away like fraying, half-forgotten dreams."
    + the first third is a silence that makes people feel uncomfortable in it's direct presence.

interestingly, each paragraph about the first third of silence features the same exact sentence below:
  * "if there had been music...but no, of course there was no music"
    + this suggests that it is possible to find the first third in the presence of music, if only kvothe would allow it's return.  what the first third looks like in the presence of music is a question still to be answered or dreamed of.  kvothe seems determined to keep the first third of silence at bay, for reasons that should become more clear when we get to kvothe's third of silence.

##### the second third:
the second third silence is the silence of *the spirit* -- more specifically, the *holy spirit*.  this is the aspect that inspires and moves men, whispering ideas in the day and planting dreams in the night.  it drives how you interact and influence others.  the spirit's realm is over the cognitive world, striking deep into the social and emotional core of who we are.

some quotes from the bookends and how they align with the spirit:
  * ""

##### the third third:
the third third silence is the silence of *the son*, the aspect which came to live among us -- and die among us as well.  the son is a trickier aspect than the other two, for the son is more abstract than the father and the spirit (and you can see that in the bookends themselves, with every one noting "the third silence was not an easy thing to notice").  whereas
