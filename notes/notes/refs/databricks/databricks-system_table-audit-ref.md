| unityCatalog                | generateTemporaryModelVersionCredential           | A temporary credential is generated when a user performs a write (during initial model version creaiton) or read (after the model version has been finalized) on a model version. You can use this event to determine who accessed a model version and when.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | full_name_arg version_arg operation model_version_url credential_id credential_type credential_kind workspace_id metastore_id                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
