- private data science
    * set limits on aggregation to ensure data is de-identified
    * how do you share information with untrusted parties?
    * federated data markets
    * run broad/aggregated compute on data without exposing underlying identifiable information
    * look into: preprocessing data to anonymize (similar to census data) vs enabling "run your code in our environment"
- private computing
    * anonymous computation via cloud platform
- openmined
    * submit query through openmind and they transform it to ensure privacy
